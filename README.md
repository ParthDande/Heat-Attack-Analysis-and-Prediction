 # Heart Attack Prediction 


- Overview
This Kaggle notebook analyzes a dataset related to human habits and features, with the goal of predicting whether a person is at risk of having a heart attack. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models to achieve this objective.

- Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, physical activity, and more. The target variable is whether the individual has had a heart attack (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure:

### Notebooks :
heart-attack-prediction.ipynb - main file 

### Data:
heart.csv

### Additional files
README.md: Project overview and instructions.


## Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

1. Load and clean the data.
2. Handle missing values and outliers.
3. Encode categorical features.
4. Feature scaling.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of features.
Analyze correlations between features and the target variable.
Identify significant patterns that contribute to heart attack risk.

Modeling & Evaluation : Used Auto Ml library to get the best model .
